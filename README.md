HELMpy is an open source package of power flow solvers.

This package contains the Holomorphic Embedding Load flow Method (HELM) and
    the Newton-Raphson (NR) algorithm.
The intention of HELMpy is to support research, especially on the HELM,
    and to contribute with the development of open source code
    related to this subject.
The developed code is properly commented and organized
    so it would be easy to understand and modify.

## Compatibility

This package is compatible with Python 3.6 and 3.7.

## History

This package was developed by Tulio Molina and Juan José Ortega
    as a part of their thesis research
    to obtain the degree of Electrical Engineer
    at Universidad de los Andes (ULA) in Mérida, Venezuela.
